Thank you for playing Dragon Maker created by Adam and Andrew\n
with tools from the Tiny Game Engine. Tiny Game Engine was built\n
to give ruby developers an easy way to build a menu system and game\n
event system for your game!\n\n
================================================================\n
---------------------NAVIGATING THE MENUS-----------------------\n
================================================================\n
[back] - To go back to the previous menu type 'back' and press\n
enter.\n 
[quit] - To quit the game entirely type 'quit' in a menu and press\n
enter.\n 
[1-9] - choose a menu item by typing the number and pressing enter\n\n

--------------------------INSTRUCTIONS--------------------------\n
================================================================\n
+Create dragons using dragon eggs. You begin with three eggs.\n
+Create a raid by selecting dragons to raid with, and then the\n
 village you wish to raid. The first time you raid a village, a\n
 knight will arrive afterwards to defend against future raids, and\n
 more knights will appear in that village over time.\n
+After a dragon participates in a raid, it will need a turn to rest\n
 before it can raid again. If a dragon is injured in a raid, it will\n
 need three turns to recover.\n
+Each time you raid a village defended by knights, you have a\n
 chance to acquire a new dragon egg.\n
+Later, slayers will begin appearing in villages. Slayers\n
 specialize in killing dragons, and pose a far greater threat than\n
 knights do. Over time, villages will begin to train knights and\n
 slayers more rapidly. You will be notified each time a new slayer\n
 spawns.\n
+Eventually, villages with large armies may begin attacking you\n
 between turns. Make sure you have enough dragons to defend against\n
 such attacks.\n
+Your objective is to continue for as long as you can. You will\n
 lose if all of your dragons are killed and you have no eggs, or if\n
 you exhaust the food supply.\n\n
